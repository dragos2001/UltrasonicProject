## ðŸš€Project Overview

Ultrasonic sensors provide reliable range information for object detection in parking scenarios. Height classification is a paradigm where sinGle or multiple ultra sonic sensors are used in order to estimate the height of identified objects in the scene with the scope of determining if the object are traversable or not by the car.

In order to do that echo detection and feature extraction are essential for building robust algorithms for identifying the type of object. For this are applying both signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to effectively extract and process information from the analog signal, which encapsulates the information of ultra sound waves reflected by objects situated in the surrounding of the vehicle.

This project develops both online and post-processing methods for ultrasonic echo detection and integrates them into a classification pipeline. The extracted features are used to train machine learning models for height classification tasks on a rp2350 micro-controller.
